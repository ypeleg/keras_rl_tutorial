## 1. *How to tune in*?

If you wanted to listen to someone speaks three hours straight about deep learning, You could have done so by the comfort of your house. 

But you are here! Physically!

So...

This tutorial is extremely hands-on! You are strongly encouraged to play with it yourself!  

### Options: 


### $\varepsilon$.  Run the notebooks locally 
- `git clone https://github.com/ypeleg/keras_rl_tutorial`


- You might think that the goal of this tutorial is for you to play around with Deep Learning. This is wrong.

- **The Rreal Goal of the Tutorial is To give you the Flexibility to use this In your own domain!** 

Therefore, this is by far the best option if you can get it working! 

------


### a. Play with the _notebooks_ dynamically (on Google Colab) 

- Anyone can use the [colab.research.google.com/notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) website (by [clicking](XXX) on the icon bellow) to run the notebook in her/his web-browser. You can then play with it as long as you like! 
- For this tutorial:
[![Google Colab](https://badgen.net/badge/Launch/on%20Google%20Colab/blue?icon=terminal)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ypeleg/keras_rl_tutorial)
------

### b. Play with the _notebooks_ dynamically (on MyBinder) 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/github/ypeleg/keras_rl_tutorial)

Anyone can use the [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) website (by [clicking](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/github/ypeleg/keras_rl_tutorial) on the icon above) to run the notebook in her/his web-browser.
You can then play with it as long as you like, for instance by modifying the values or experimenting with the code.

### c. View the _notebooks_ statically. (if all else failed..)
- Either directly in GitHub: [ypeleg/ExpertDL](https://github.com/ypeleg/keras_rl_tutorial);
- Or on nbviewer: [notebooks](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ypeleg/keras_rl_tutorial/).

## One More thing..

You are probably famillier with this.. so..

### The tachles.py file

In this tutorial many of the irrelevant details are hidden in a special file called "tachles.py".
Simply go:

```python
import tachles
```

# Requirements


This tutorial requires the following packages:

- Python version 3.5
    - Other versions of Python should be fine as well. 
    - but.. *who knows*? :P
    
- `numpy` version 1.10 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `scipy` version 0.16 or later: http://www.scipy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.4 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `pandas` version 0.16 or later: http://pandas.pydata.org
- `scikit-learn` version 0.15 or later: http://scikit-learn.org
- `keras` version 2.0 or later: http://keras.io
- `tensorflow` version 1.0 or later: https://www.tensorflow.org
- `ipython`/`jupyter` version 4.0 or later, with notebook support

(Optional but recommended):

- `pyyaml`
- `hdf5` and `h5py` (required if you use model saving/loading functions in keras)
- **NVIDIA cuDNN** if you have NVIDIA GPUs on your machines.
    [https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download]()

The easiest way to get (most) these is to use an all-in-one installer such as [Anaconda](http://www.continuum.io/downloads) from Continuum. These are available for multiple architectures.

### Python Version


I'm currently running this tutorial with **Python 3** on **Anaconda**

```python
!python --version
```

<!-- #region -->
### Configure Keras with tensorflow

1) Create the `keras.json` (if it does not exist):

```shell
touch $HOME/.keras/keras.json
```

2) Copy the following content into the file:

```
{
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "backend": "tensorflow",
    "floatx": "float32",
    "image_data_format": "channels_last"
}
```
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
!cat ~/.keras/keras.json
```

# Test if everything is up&running


## 1. Check import

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn
```

```python
import keras
```

## 2. Check installeded Versions

```python
import numpy
print('numpy:', numpy.__version__)

import scipy
print('scipy:', scipy.__version__)

import matplotlib
print('matplotlib:', matplotlib.__version__)

import IPython
print('iPython:', IPython.__version__)

import sklearn
print('scikit-learn:', sklearn.__version__)
```

```python
import keras
print('keras: ', keras.__version__)

# optional
import theano
print('Theano: ', theano.__version__)

import tensorflow as tf
print('Tensorflow: ', tf.__version__)
```
